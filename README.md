# About

PolyFlowBuilder is a tool allows you to easily visualize and plan your academic path during your stay at Cal Poly SLO.

I wrote this during the Summer of 2020 from scratch, and it's my first full-stack, production-quality web app. Meant as a replacement to the aging PolyFlows, it is much more up-to-date, is being actively developed, and aims to make course planning at CPSLO as efficient and productive as possible.

Take PolyFlowBuilder for a spin on the [official website](https://polyflowbuilder.duncanapple.io).

## Main Features

- Can create flowcharts with a specified catalog year, starting year, major, and concentration (if applicable), and it will auto-populate with the respective flowchart (if it's available)
- Default flowchart templates are available for the 2015-2017 catalog all the way up to the 2022-2026 catalog
- Drag-and-drop interface for managing individual courses on your flowchart
- Each class contains information about its catalog description, unit count, and prerequisites (if any)
- Can color your classes with specific and custom colors (designating major classes, support classes, GEs, etc...)
- You can export your created flowchart as a PDF for printing or for markup (I find this especially handy myself) (will be improved in future updates)
- You can validate your flowchart to ensure that you have the minimum units, minimum upper-division units, GWR class, USCP class, Curriculum Sheet validation, and class-by-class prerequisite validation (with curriculum sheet validation planned in the future!)
- Can add notes to your flowchart
- Can add/remove terms from your flowchart (i.e. if you're taking summer classes at CP)
- Can create custom classes (i.e. if you need an "elective" placeholder, or anything else of that nature)
- "Credit Bin" allows you to keep track of courses you've earned units for towards your degree that you got from other instutitions (e.g. incoming transfer units, floating units, etc.)
- Can create as many flows as you need to succeed
- Term data is included in course information if available, sourced from public Cal Poly data provided by the Registrar's Office

## Roadmap
